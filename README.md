# PT-axes and Triangle diagram
Plot PT-axes into polar diagram and the triangle diagram
***************************************

  Open-source Matlab functions for plotting PT-axes into polar diagram,
and triangle diagram (Frohlich 1992) of DC focal mechanisms.

1 METHODOLOGY
===================

  Frohlich, C. (1992). Triangle diagrams: ternary graphs to display
similarity and diversity of earthquake focal mechanisms, Physics of the
Earth and Planetary Interiors, 75, 193-198.

2 PACKAGE CONTENT
===================

  a) "PTaxesPlot.m" - Matlab code that plot PT-axes of DC focal
  mechanisms into the polarplot diagram
  
  b) "TrianglePlot.m" - Classification of source focal mechanisms
  (strike-slip, reverse, normal, odd) and plot the triangle diagram.

3 REQUIREMENTS
===================

  MATLAB: Codes do not require any additional Matlab Toolboxes.
